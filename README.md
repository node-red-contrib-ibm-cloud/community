# Node-RED nodes for IBM Cloud

Welcome to the community for [IBM Cloud-related](https://cloud.ibm.com) [Node-RED](https://nodered.org) nodes.

This organisation is home to a number of Node-RED nodes that relate to IBM Cloud technologies and services.

Historically, these nodes have been developed and maintained by individuals. This organisation is a space to bring the individual nodes together, to help foster best practices, collaboration and help with their ongoing maintenance.

# Getting Involved

This organisation is open to *anyone* who wants to help maintain the nodes within it. You don't have to be an IBMer to get involved!

# Contributing

This organisation is in its inital bootstrapping phase. This means we are still figuring out the details of how we want to operate and what governance is needed.

We have an initial list of nodes to bring into this organisation and we will be working with their authors to make that happen.
